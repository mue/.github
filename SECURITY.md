# Security
Security and privacy are some of our top priorities at Mue. If you believe you've found a vulnerability in any Mue repository (github.com/mue) please report it to us as described below.

## Important Information
Remember: **Do not attempt to damage the Mue APIs or services**, for example via DDOS, spamming and brute force attacks.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please instead report them directly to us at hello@muetab.com with ``SECURITY: <issue here>`` as the subject field, replacing ``<issue here>`` with brief information as to what the issue is 
and what repository it occurs on.
